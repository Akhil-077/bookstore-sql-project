# bookstore-sql-project
SQL project simulating a bookstore database with tables for Books and Orders, queries for sales analysis, and inventory tracking.



 ðŸ“š Bookstore SQL Project  
I built this project to practice SQL by designing a simple database for a bookstore.  
The idea was to manage books, track customer orders, and keep an eye on the stock.  
Itâ€™s a small project, but it helped me apply a lot of important SQL concepts.  

## ðŸ›  What the project does
- Stores book details (title, author, genre, price, stock).  
- Records customer orders and the quantity of books ordered.  
- Calculates how much stock is left after orders are fulfilled.  
- Lets me write queries to find insights like:
  - Which books are selling the most  
  - Which books are out of stock  
  - How inventory changes over time  


## ðŸ—‚ Database Structure
- **Books** â†’ Book_Id, Title, Author, Genre, Published_Year, Price, Stock  
- **Orders** â†’ Order_Id, Book_Id, Quantity, Order_Date
